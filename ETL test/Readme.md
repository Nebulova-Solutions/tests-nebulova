# ETL test

Complete the following three challenges and send the code back to us in **less than two hours**. 
Any plagiarism detected in the code will trigger your immediate exclusion from the selection process where you are right now.

## Challenge 1
Given the challenge_1.py python file, fix it to make it as fast as possible.  

## Challenge 2
Given a time series in challenge_2.py, performs a resample rows second-by-second operation and fills in null values with the last seen value for that variable.

## Challenge 3
The number 197 is called a circular prime because all the rotations of its digits (not to be confused with all the permutations):
- 197,
- 971
- and 719
they are primes in themselves.

By way of example, the following numbers meet the circular prime condition: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many numbers fulfilling the condition of being a circular prime are there less than 1000000 (one million)?
Create a short Python program that allows you to find the answer to the previous question.
